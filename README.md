# Overview

The program name Locult is an artificial join from 'Localization' and 'Culture',
because this software is about localizing string resources for other software development projects.
The localization process can be manually but is supported by the API from Microsoft Translator as
described at: [service based machine learning translation from Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/translator/translatorapi.aspx).

This API lets you translate string resources in a simple configure and click scenario.
You can translate into more languages than only those that you speak. I routinely localize
my own projects in about 10 languages with Locult. The result of this process is that about
80% of the entire population on this planet can use my open source software with their native language preference.

## Limitations
The project is currently able to localize only *RESX* string resources, but the architecture is setup to support other file formats in the near future. Please let me know via Issue or Discussion item if you require the translation of other file formats.

I have originally developed this project based on Yalv! with two other software developers on CodePlex:
